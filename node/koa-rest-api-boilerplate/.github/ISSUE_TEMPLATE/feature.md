### Description
<!--
What exactly are you suggesting? Is it a particular missing feature? An odd
design choice you think could be improved? This doesn't need to be a concrete,
fully-fledged proposal, but it does need to be clear - it's hard to act on
suggestions that are too vague or generic.
-->


### Why
<!--
Why is this important to you? How would you use it? We need to know what
problems it would solve in the real world and what benefits it would bring, for
both you and other potential users, so we know how we should prioritize it and
so we can see if a better solution might exist.
-->


### Possible Solutions
<!--
Optional: How might this be implemented? This is optional, but it helps us put
the size and cost of the feature into perspective. Simpler features to implement
can often be justified by just being helpful, but big, complex features could
require a massive benefit to pay for their size, scale, and complexity.
-->


### Open Questions
<!--
Optional: What things still need discussed? If there are certain details you
aren't sure about, this could help inform discussion.
